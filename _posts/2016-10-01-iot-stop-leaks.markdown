TechLab delivers a working prototype to help homeowners to avoid water damage in their homes. You'll be amazed at a great number of insurance cases, where homeowners face insurance to cover water damage at their homes caused by open taps or leaking washing machines.

Both homeowners and insurers would like to avoid such cases. Here IoT comes in play, as Techlab develops a solution that detects water leakages and switches off water at your home or apartment. Tiny sensors at the floor level detect water, send signal and main switch is automatically shut. Plus, the homeowner may receive a notification on the phone. Nevertheless, a water damage is prevented.
